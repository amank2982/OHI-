    <p>It is our great pleasure to extend you all a very warm welcome to attend OHI-2023 (Nov. 01-03, 2023) in the holy city of Mathura and Vrindavan. Mathura is the birthplace of Lord Krishna, where pilgrims from all over the world come every year. The twin cities of Mathura and Vrindavan along with a number of other towns house a large number of temples associated with life and times of the Lord Krishna. Large numbers of folk stories are around this entire region called, Braj. Because of housing a large number of cows in Braj, the soil is considered holy and sweets made from the milk of cows in this region have special taste and are sent globally as ‘Prasad’. The entire Braj is being developed for the purpose of religious tourism. Therefore, the twin cities offer you a range of high standard facilities and activities over a small area, enough to make it easy to take the best out of it while you are in attendance for the OHI-2023 or the days around it. Weather at this time of year is the beginning of winter and is pleasant. </p>
